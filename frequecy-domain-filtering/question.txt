========================================
OBJECTIVES: 
========================================

Implement the basic FREQUENCY DOMAIN FILTERING METHOD using the steps given in
Section 4.7.3 of your textbook and demonstrate the
following types of filters. 

1. Butterworth low pass filter
2. Butterworth high pass filter
3. Ideal low pass filter 
4. Ideal high pass filter
5. Laplacian filter

Each of these operations must be implemented as a separate function accepting
parameters related to the input image array, the filter array
image), the filter parameter(s) or cutoffs, and the output image to be returned. 

Demonstrate periodic noise filtering by implementing 

1. Notch reject filters
2. Band reject filters. 

It should be possible to specify the location of the notch filter
interactively by locating the frequency spike in the Fourier spectrum and
placing the notch reject filter over there. 


========================================
INTERFACE to the software: 
========================================

The interface to the software will be through a specification file. 
Your program will read the specification file and do the specified task, 
and dump the processed output results in specified files. 

The input format in the specification file is as follows. 

Input image file name: 
Filter Specs: [BL/ BH/ IL/ IH/ L/ NR/ BR/] 
Output file name: 
Radius/ Cutoff/ Filter parameter: 
Order of the filter: 



===========================================
WHEN YOU COME TO GIVE YOUR DEMO
===========================================

1. You should keep multiple such specification files ready. Each file should
be given a different name. 

2. Be ready with the explanations for your results. 

3. Your source code will be checked. Hence you need to submit your source
code. 

4. Do not make changes in your program while giving the demo. 

5. Demonstration has to be made on Fedora 10 platform with OpenCV 1.0 (the
Desktop in my office). 

6. The program should be run on the illustrative examples shown in the book.
All input arrays of binary images used in the book should be specified as 2-D
array of 0s and 1s in the specs file. IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK ON SIMPLE
2-D ARRAYS AS GIVEN IN THE TEXT BOOK YOU WILL NOT GET ANY CREDIT. 

7. Do not start typing the array while giving the demo. Use previously saved
specs files with appropriate arrays. 

8. YOU MAY PREPARE A REPORT IN PDF OF DOC IN WHICH YOU CAN LIST ALL YOUR
RESULTS (INPUT IMAGES AND CORRESPONDING OUTPUT IMAGES).
